"Updated range map of an endangered salamander and congeneric competitor reveals different niche preferences"

Paper is by: Jo A. Werba, Dave A.W. Miller, Adrianne B. Brand and Evan HC Grant

The code here is the code used for the paper, the data however is jittered to obscure any actual locations of the endangered salamander.
As a result running this code WILL NOT recreate the same results as presented in the paper. However, all the models are as run in the final manuscript.

To run  models run final_models.R.; this will also create figures found in the manuscript

To run models with different field sampling subsets run subset.R; this will also create figures found in the manuscript

All work was completed in R version 4.2.1
